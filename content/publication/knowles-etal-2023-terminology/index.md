abstract: Incorporating terminology into a neural machine translation (NMT) system
  is a feature of interest for many users of machine translation. In this case study
  of English-French Canadian Parliamentary text, we examine the performance of standard
  NMT systems at handling terminology and consider the tradeoffs between potential
  performance improvements and the efforts required to maintain terminological resources
  specifically for NMT.
