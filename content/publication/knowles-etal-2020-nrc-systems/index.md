abstract: We describe the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) neural machine
  translation systems for the German-Upper Sorbian supervised track of the 2020 shared
  task on Unsupervised MT and Very Low Resource Supervised MT. Our models are ensembles
  of Transformer models, built using combinations of BPE-dropout, lexical modifications,
  and backtranslation.
