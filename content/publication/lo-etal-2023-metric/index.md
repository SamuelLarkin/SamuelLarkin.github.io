abstract: The Metric Score Landscape Challenge (MSLC23) dataset aims to gain insight
  into metric scores on a broader/wider landscape of machine translation (MT) quality.
  It provides a collection of low- to medium-quality MT output on the WMT23 general
  task test set. Together with the high quality systems submitted to the general task,
  this will enable better interpretation of metric scores across a range of different
  levels of translation quality. With this wider range of MT quality, we also visualize
  and analyze metric characteristics beyond just correlation.
