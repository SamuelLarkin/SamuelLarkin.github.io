 abstract = {The Metric Score Landscape Challenge (MSLC23) dataset aims to gain insight into metric scores on a broader/wider landscape of machine translation (MT) quality. It provides a collection of low- to medium-quality MT output on the WMT23 general task test set. Together with the high quality systems submitted to the general task, this will enable better interpretation of metric scores across a range of different levels of translation quality. With this wider range of MT quality, we also visualize and analyze metric characteristics beyond just correlation.},
