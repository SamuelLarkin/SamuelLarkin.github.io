abstract: We describe the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) submissions for
  the 2020 Inuktitut-English shared task on news translation at the Fifth Conference
  on Machine Translation (WMT20). Our submissions consist of ensembled domain-specific
  finetuned transformer models, trained using the Nunavut Hansard and news data and,
  in the case of Inuktitut-English, backtranslated news and parliamentary data. In
  this work we explore challenges related to the relatively small amount of parallel
  data, morphological complexity, and domain shifts.
