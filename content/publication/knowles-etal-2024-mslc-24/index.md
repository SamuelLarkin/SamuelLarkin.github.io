abstract: In this second edition of the Metric Score Landscape Challenge (MSLC), we
  examine how automatic metrics for machine translation perform on a wide variety
  of machine translation output, ranging from very low quality systems to the types
  of high-quality systems submitted to the General MT shared task at WMT. We also
  explore metric results on specific types of data, such as empty strings, wrong-
  or mixed-language text, and more. We raise several alarms about inconsistencies
  in metric scores, some of which can be resolved by increasingly explicit instructions
  for metric use, while others highlight technical flaws.
