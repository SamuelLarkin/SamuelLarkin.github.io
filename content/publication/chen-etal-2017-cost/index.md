abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation technique for neural
  machine translation called cost weighting, which is appropriate for adaptation scenarios
  in which a small in-domain data set and a large general-domain data set are available.
  Cost weighting incorporates a domain classifier into the neural machine translation
  training algorithm, using features derived from the encoder representation in order
  to distinguish in-domain from out-of-domain data. Classifier probabilities are used
  to weight sentences according to their domain similarity when updating the parameters
  of the neural translation model. We compare cost weighting to two traditional domain
  adaptation techniques developed for statistical machine translation: data selection
  and sub-corpus weighting. Experiments on two large-data tasks show that both the
  traditional techniques and our novel proposal lead to significant gains, with cost
  weighting outperforming the traditional methods.'
