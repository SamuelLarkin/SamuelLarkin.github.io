abstract: Novel terminology and changes in terminology are often a challenge for machine
  translation systems. The passing of Queen Elizabeth II and the accession of King
  Charles III provide a striking example of translation shift in the real world, particularly
  in translation contexts that have ambiguity. Examining translation between French
  and English, we present a focused case-study of translations about King Charles
  III as produced both by publicly-available MT systems and by a neural machine translation
  system trained specifically on Canadian parliamentary text. We find that even in
  cases where human translators would have adequate context to disambiguate terms
  from the source language, machine translation systems do not always produce the
  expected output. Where we are able to analyze the training data, we note that this
  may represent artifacts in the data, raising important questions about machine translation
  updates in light of real world events.
