abstract: We present a preliminary study on the feasibility of using current natural
  language processing techniques to detect variations between the construction codes
  of different jurisdictions. We formulate the task as a sentence alignment problem
  and evaluate various sentence representation models for their performance in this
  task. Our results show that task-specific trained embeddings perform marginally
  better than other models, but the overall accuracy remains a challenge. We also
  show that domain-specific fine-tuning hurts the task performance. The results highlight
  the challenges of developing NLP applications for technical regulatory texts.
