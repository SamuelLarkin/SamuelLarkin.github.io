abstract: We describe the NRC-CNRC systems submitted to the AmericasNLP shared task
  on machine translation. We submitted systems translating from Spanish into Wixárika,
  Nahuatl, Rarámuri, and Guaranı́. Our best neural machine translation systems used
  multilingual pretraining, ensembling, finetuning, training on parts of the development
  data, and subword regularization. We also submitted translation memory systems as
  a strong baseline.
