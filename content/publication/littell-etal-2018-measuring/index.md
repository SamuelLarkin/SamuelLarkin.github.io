abstract: The WMT18 shared task on parallel corpus filtering (Koehn et al., 2018b)
  challenged teams to score sentence pairs from a large high-recall, low-precision
  web-scraped parallel corpus (Koehn et al., 2018a). Participants could use existing
  sample corpora (e.g. past WMT data) as a supervisory signal to learn what a ``cleanâ€³
  corpus looks like. However, in lower-resource situations it often happens that the
  target corpus of the language is the textitonly sample of parallel text in that
  language. We therefore made several unsupervised entries, setting ourselves an additional
  constraint that we not utilize the additional clean parallel corpora. One such entry
  fairly consistently scored in the top ten systems in the 100M-word conditions, and
  for one task---translating the European Medicines Agency corpus (Tiedemann, 2009)---scored
  among the best systems even in the 10M-word conditions.
