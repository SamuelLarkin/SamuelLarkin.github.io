abstract: We describe our neural machine translation systems for the 2021 shared task
  on Unsupervised and Very Low Resource Supervised MT, translating between Upper Sorbian
  and German (low-resource) and between Lower Sorbian and German (unsupervised). The
  systems incorporated data filtering, backtranslation, BPE-dropout, ensembling, and
  transfer learning from high(er)-resource languages. As measured by automatic metrics,
  our systems showed strong performance, consistently placing first or tied for first
  across most metrics and translation directions.
