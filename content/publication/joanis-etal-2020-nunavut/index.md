abstract: The Inuktitut language, a member of the Inuit-Yupik-Unangan language family,
  is spoken across Arctic Canada and noted for its morphological complexity. It is
  an official language of two territories, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories,
  and has recognition in additional regions. This paper describes a newly released
  sentence-aligned Inuktitut--English corpus based on the proceedings of the Legislative
  Assembly of Nunavut, covering sessions from April 1999 to June 2017. With approximately
  1.3 million aligned sentence pairs, this is, to our knowledge, the largest parallel
  corpus of a polysynthetic language or an Indigenous language of the Americas released
  to date. The paper describes the alignment methodology used, the evaluation of the
  alignments, and preliminary experiments on statistical and neural machine translation
  (SMT and NMT) between Inuktitut and English, in both directions.
