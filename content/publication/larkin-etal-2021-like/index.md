abstract: 'We revisit the topic of translation direction in the data used for training
  neural machine translation systems and focusing on a real-world scenario with known
  translation direction and imbalances in translation direction: the Canadian Hansard.
  According to automatic metrics and we observe that using parallel data that was
  produced in the ``matchingâ€³ translation direction (Authentic source and translationese
  target) improves translation quality. In cases of data imbalance in terms of translation
  direction and we find that tagging of translation direction can close the performance
  gap. We perform a human evaluation that differs slightly from the automatic metrics
  and but nevertheless confirms that for this French-English dataset that is known
  to contain high-quality translations and authentic or tagged mixed source improves
  over translationese source for training.'
