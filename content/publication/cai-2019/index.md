abstract: Messages posted on social media such as Twitter and Instagram are a rich
  and promising source of information on real-life events. However, due to the high
  volume and the noisy nature of posts on social media, the messages reporting events
  are usually overwhelmed by unrelated daily chatter. To detect unspecified events,
  many topic modeling and wavelet signal processing methods have been proposed. In
  this paper, we propose an improved method, BCCED, using a burstiness index and co-occurrence
  clustering for event detection, that builds on the Event Detection with Clustering
  of Wavelet-based Signals (EDCoW) method of Weng et al. [2011]. We compare their
  performance with two topic modeling methods on two social media datasets. Experiments
  show that BCCED outperforms these alternatives for unspecified event detection from
  social media.
