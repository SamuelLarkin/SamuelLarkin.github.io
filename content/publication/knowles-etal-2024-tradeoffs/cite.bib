 abstract = {In long-term translation projects, like Parliamentary text, there is a desire to build machine translation systems that can adapt to changes over time. We implement and examine a simple approach to continual learning for neural machine translation, exploring tradeoffs between consistency, the model`s ability to learn from incoming data, and the time a client would need to wait to obtain a newly trained translation system.},
