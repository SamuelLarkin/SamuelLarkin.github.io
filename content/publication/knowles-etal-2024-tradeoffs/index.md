abstract: In long-term translation projects, like Parliamentary text, there is a desire
  to build machine translation systems that can adapt to changes over time. We implement
  and examine a simple approach to continual learning for neural machine translation,
  exploring tradeoffs between consistency, the model`s ability to learn from incoming
  data, and the time a client would need to wait to obtain a newly trained translation
  system.
