abstract: We describe the neural machine translation (NMT) system developed at the
  National Research Council of Canada (NRC) for the Kazakh-English news translation
  task of the Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT19). Our submission is
  a multi-source NMT taking both the original Kazakh sentence and its Russian translation
  as input for translating into English.
